Some of the scripts used to model and simulate data used in Vilidaite, Yu & Baker (2017). Internal noise estimates correlate with autistic traits. Autism Research, 10(8), 1384-1391. doi: 10.1002/aur.1781
and Vilidaite & Baker (2016). Individual differences in internal noise are consistent across two measurement techniques. Vision Research, 141, 30-39. doi.org/10.1016/j.visres.2016.10.008

In this project simple 2-alternative forced choice judgement tasks were used (contrast, facial expression intensity and number summation) to assess neural noise in three brain areas as consistency.
